## Types of files
There are many different ways to store data. Three popular methods are *.csv*, *.xlsx* and *.txt* files. Each of these have 
special uses (and benefits in varying situations.)


## Writing a .csv
*.csv* stands for *comma seperated values* which is method used to store data. These types of files provide a logical way to 
store data in a tabular format. The following can be seen as a .csv
```csv
Index, height, age
1, 176, 24
2, 178, 67
3, 165, 45
4, 192, 42
5, 230, 32
```

## Reading a .csv 

## Excel: working with spreadsheets
Excel is an integral part of many businesses due to the ability to easily store, manipulate and save large amounts of relational data.
To work with *.xlsx* files you first need to install (download from the PyPi repository) the module *openpyxl*. To do this:
1. Click the 'start panel'. 
2. Type in 'command prompt' and press 'enter'. 
3. In the black box that appears, type ```python pip install openpyxl ```
Note: if the above fails, ensure you are one the Wi-Fi network 'wsa'.

### Reading a .xlsx
With *openpyxl*, reading from excel spreadsheets is easy. However, one 'rookie error' is the '[Error 13] Permission denied error' 
which is a result of trying to open an excel spreadsheet that is currently open. If you encounter this error, ensure the spreadsheet
you are referencing is closed.
